items within a variety of categories, as well as provide a user registration and authentication system.

## Solution Description
This project is item an catalog of computer components (processors, graphic cards, memories, etc.).

The project use the following libraries:

        flask
        sqlalchemy

I recommend to use ```virtualenv```. If your system does not have it you can install it via pip command: ```pip install virtualenv```.

    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r req

Now you can start application server. To do it run script startserver.sh.

    bash runserver.sh
